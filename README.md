# Krieffer_09nodeJS

## README Generator
  This assignment was to create a command-line application to generate a README.md from the users input. I used the inquirer package to ask the user for the information needed to generate a README.md.

### Running the Application
  The gif below shows to run the application you type node.js, make sure you have already installed the necessary packages. Note: this application requires node.js and the inquirer package.

### Finishing the Application
  After each question is answered, it prompts the next question.

### Getting the README
  When the application is done, it creates a README.md file using the users input.
